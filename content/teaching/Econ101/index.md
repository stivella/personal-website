I was the main instructor for the Bocconi summer school course in Game Theory

### Description

Bocconi holds a summer school for high school students who are interested in economics. The course I taught was an introduction to game theory.
I covered the basics of game theory, including the concepts of Nash equilibrium, dominant strategies, and the prisoner's dilemma. 
I introduced students to the concept of repeated games, and the idea of subgame perfect equilibria.
Lastly, I gave them an overview of some more advanced topics, such as evolutionary game theory or incomplete information interactions (such as Akerlof's lemons model or auctions).
The course was taught in English and was designed to be interactive, with students working on problems in groups.
