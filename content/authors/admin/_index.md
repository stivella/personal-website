I am a 6th-year Phd student in Economics at Bocconi University.\
I will be on the academic job market in Fall 2025.\
In Winter and Spring 2025 I visited professor Ufuk Akcigit at the University of Chicago.
<!--
Before that, I was as a honors student at [Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies](https://www.santannapisa.it/en) in Pisa, where I earned my Master's degree in Economics.\
-->


My research examines the career transitions of highly skilled workers to assess whether they transfer their expertise when changing jobs.
I find that such transfers can influence key economic outcomes, including credit allocation, innovation, and scientific productivity.

My job market paper - coauthored with Angelo D'Andrea (Bank of Italy) - demonstrates that bank managers can carry their client portfolios when moving to a competitor, thereby improving the efficiency of credit allocation in the economy.

A second project investigates the limited transferability of specialized scientific human capital with Italian nuclear physicists.
After facing a large negative funding shock, they struggled to reallocate their expertise to new fields, resulting in lower productivity.

# I am working in the fields of Economics of Science and Innovation.
# In my research so far, I tried to go after two questions: First, how do scientists and engineers transfer their skills to new contexts, and possibly generate innovation and growth? Second, when and how should the public sector direct technological change?
# I tried to answer to the first question by studying the careers of Italian nuclear scientists, whose field of studies was defunded after the Chernobyl disaster. In another project I studied how public procurement impacts US innovative small businesses.\
