I am a 5th-year Phd student in Economics at Bocconi University. Before that, I was as a honors student at [Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies](https://www.santannapisa.it/en) in Pisa, where I earned my Master's degree in Economics.\
In Winter and Spring 2025 I will be visiting professor Ufuk Akcigit at the University of Chicago.


In my research so far, I tried to understand how high skilled workers' mobility can help knowledge diffuse.
I approached this question in two separate cases.\
The first one pertains to the field of Economics of Science.
In particular, I studied the careers of Italian nuclear scientists, whose field of studies was defunded after the Chernobyl disaster.
I found that these scientists were not successful in transferring their skills to other fields, as their human capital was too specific.\
In a second project, with Angelo D'Andrea (Bank of Italy), I consider a different population of movers: bank managers.
Combining Italian data on bank managers'careers with data on bank lending, I find that when a bank manager moves to a new bank, 5% of their previous bank's clients follow them.\

# I am working in the fields of Economics of Science and Innovation.
# In my research so far, I tried to go after two questions: First, how do scientists and engineers transfer their skills to new contexts, and possibly generate innovation and growth? Second, when and how should the public sector direct technological change?
# I tried to answer to the first question by studying the careers of Italian nuclear scientists, whose field of studies was defunded after the Chernobyl disaster. In another project I studied how public procurement impacts US innovative small businesses.\
