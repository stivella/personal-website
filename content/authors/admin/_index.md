I am a Phd student in Economics at Bocconi University. Before that, I grew up in a small village close to Pavia. In 2015 I received a scholarship as a honors student at the [Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies](https://www.santannapisa.it/en) and I moved to Pisa .

I hold a Master's Degree in Economics, earned in a [program](https://mse.ec.unipi.it) that was jointly developed by Sant'Anna School and the [University of Pisa](https://www.ec.unipi.it).

I am working in the fields of Economics of Science and Innovation.\
In particular, I would like to study how scientists can become experts in a specific field, and then bring those competences to new fields, generating innovation.
In my last project, I have used the Chernobyl referendum in Italy as a natural experiment that moved scientists to new scientific fields.
