In this paper - for the first time - we are able to link administrative data on loan contracts and employment histories to track the movements of bank managers and their portfolios of client firms across financial institutions. We show that when a manager switches employers, firms in their prior portfolio are three times more likely to initiate a lending relationship with the new bank. To isolate the causal role of manager mobility, we exploit variation in the timing of job switches and leverage exogenous shocks to mobility induced by branch closures. This effect reflects both a higher propensity of firms to apply for credit and a greater likelihood of loan approval. We further document that the resulting lending relationships are associated with lower interest rates and lower default rates. Our findings underscore the importance of individual-level human capital in improving credit market outcomes and highlight a novel channel for information transmission in the financial sector.","tags":[],"title":"Bankers on the Move: Relationship Capital in Credit Markets","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"I was the main instructor for the Bocconi summer school course in Game Theory\nDescription Bocconi holds a summer school for high school students who are interested in economics. The course I taught was an introduction to game theory. I covered the basics of game theory, including the concepts of Nash equilibrium, dominant strategies, and the prisoner’s dilemma. I introduced students to the concept of repeated games, and the idea of subgame perfect equilibria. Lastly, I gave them an overview of some more advanced topics, such as evolutionary game theory or incomplete information interactions (such as Akerlof’s lemons model or auctions). The course was taught in English and was designed to be interactive, with students working on problems in groups.\nMaterials The entire course material is on the website Summer School ","date":1720393200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1720393200,"objectID":"0275d777895c638924a4302fca77d84d","permalink":"https://stivella.github.io/teaching/econ101/","publishdate":"2024-07-08T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/teaching/econ101/","section":"teaching","summary":"Instructor","tags":null,"title":"Game Theory","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"I am the Teaching Assistant for the undergraduate course in Microeconomics at Bocconi University (code 30065)\nClasses CLEAM 1, for professor Nicoletta Corrocher (2021-on)\nCLEAM 2, for professors Fausto Panunzi and Monica Bonacina (2022-on)\nMaterials The entire course material is on the website Econ 101 ","date":1694473200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694473200,"objectID":"434cc1df6a35063388caa77864ecbb1d","permalink":"https://stivella.github.io/teaching/econ101-summer-school/","publishdate":"2023-09-12T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/teaching/econ101-summer-school/","section":"teaching","summary":"Teaching Assistant","tags":null,"title":"Econ 101","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"I am the Teaching Assistant for the undergraduate course in Macroeconomics at Bocconi University (code 30066)\nClasses CLEF 9 and 10, for professor Michela Braga (Spring 2023 and 2024) Materials The entire course material is on the website Econ 102 ","date":1694473200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694473200,"objectID":"b2e55dee053c44e14808556bd1488f01","permalink":"https://stivella.github.io/teaching/econ102/","publishdate":"2023-09-12T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/teaching/econ102/","section":"teaching","summary":"Teaching Assistant","tags":null,"title":"Econ 102","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"I am the Teaching Assistant for the undergraduate course in Industry Analysis at Bocconi University (code 20133 )\nClasses CLEAM 8, for professor Mariarosa Battagion, Christian Garavaglia and Stefano Breschi (2022-on)\nCLEAM 9, for professor Mariarosa Battagion, Myriam Mariani and Stefano Breschi (2022-on)\nMaterials The entire course material is on the website Industry analysis ","date":1694473200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694473200,"objectID":"b99482215879d42c3c67e7475db71868","permalink":"https://stivella.github.io/teaching/industryanalysis/","publishdate":"2023-09-12T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/teaching/industryanalysis/","section":"teaching","summary":"Teaching Assistant","tags":null,"title":"Industry Analysis","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"I am the Teaching Assistant for the undergraduate course in Mechanism Design at Bocconi University (code 30419)\nClasses BEMACS 2021-22, for professors Fausto Panunzi and Tangren Feng\nBEMACS 2022-23, 2023-24, for professor Nenad Kos\nMaterials The entire course material is on the website Mech Design ","date":1694473200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694473200,"objectID":"391891a880a32a85d3529e867b650bad","permalink":"https://stivella.github.io/teaching/mechdesign/","publishdate":"2023-09-12T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/teaching/mechdesign/","section":"teaching","summary":"Teaching Assistant","tags":null,"title":"Mechanism Design","type":"teaching"},{"authors":["Enrico Stivella"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1693526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693526400,"objectID":"228d27b56e1f2977a8656c43a24364a1","permalink":"https://stivella.github.io/publication/procurementsbir/","publishdate":"2023-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/procurementsbir/","section":"publication","summary":"Economists have been long debating about the effectiveness of policies aimed at inducing directed technical change.

In 1987 in Italy a referendum stopped the production of nuclear energy, and strongly reduced fundings to research in that ﬁeld. Using data from Microsoft Academic Graph, I show that after Chernobyl the amount of Italian papers published in nuclear ﬁssion decreased by 50%. Researchers who had already published in ﬁssion experienced a reduction of 24% in their citations, and 7% in published papers 15 years after the shock.
