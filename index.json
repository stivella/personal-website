I study how flexible it is, trying to understand if researchers can bring valuable contributions to innovation out of their main field of studies. I focus on the careers of Italian nuclear scientists before and after the Chernobyl disaster of 1986. The following year in Italy a referendum stopped the production of nuclear energy, and strongly reduced fundings to research in that field. Using Microsoft Academic Graph, I show that nuclear fission scientists were not able to relocate outside their main field. After Chernobyl, the amount of Italian papers published in nuclear fission decreased by 50%. Researchers who had already published in fission experienced a reduction of 25% in their citations, and 10% in published papers. Compared to other physicists, they neither moved more frequently, nor contributed permanently to more new fields.","tags":[],"title":"Scientific resilience: How Italian nuclear physics changed after the Chernobyl disaster","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"I am the Teaching Assistant for the undergraduate course in Macroeconomics at Bocconi University (code 30066)\nClasses TBD\nTBD\nMaterials The entire course material is on the website Econ 102 ","date":1661986800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661986800,"objectID":"aaf037a31c14a455b9249ce2d0388fa1","permalink":"https://enricostivella.github.io/teaching/macroeconomics101/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/teaching/macroeconomics101/","section":"teaching","summary":"Teaching Assistant","tags":null,"title":"Econ 102","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"I am the Teaching Assistant for the undergraduate course in Industry Analysis at Bocconi University (code 20133 )\nClasses CLEAM 8, for professor Mariarosa Battagion, Christian Garavaglia and Stefano Breschi (2022-on)\nCLEAM 9, for professor Mariarosa Battagion, Myriam Mariani and Stefano Breschi (2022-on)\nMaterials The entire course material is on the website Industry analysis ","date":1661986800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661986800,"objectID":"b99482215879d42c3c67e7475db71868","permalink":"https://enricostivella.github.io/teaching/industryanalysis/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/teaching/industryanalysis/","section":"teaching","summary":"Teaching Assistant","tags":null,"title":"Industry Analysis","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"I am the Teaching Assistant for the undergraduate course in Strategic Decision Making and Markets at Bocconi University (code 30458)\nClasses Class 13, Teaching Assistant to professor Chiara Fumagalli (2022-on) Materials The entire course material is on the website Decision Making ","date":1661986800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661986800,"objectID":"cd42da69854d65523382beff1e515b01","permalink":"https://enricostivella.github.io/teaching/strategicdecision/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/teaching/strategicdecision/","section":"teaching","summary":"Teaching Assistant","tags":null,"title":"Strategic Decision Making and Markets","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"I am the Teaching Assistant for the undergraduate course in Mechanism Design at Bocconi University (code 30419)\nClasses BEMACS 2021-22, for professors Fausto Panunzi and Tangren Feng\nBEMACS 2022-23, for professor Nenad Kos\nMaterials The entire course material is on the website Mech Design ","date":164367e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":164367e4,"objectID":"391891a880a32a85d3529e867b650bad","permalink":"https://enricostivella.github.io/teaching/mechdesign/","publishdate":"2022-02-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/teaching/mechdesign/","section":"teaching","summary":"Teaching Assistant","tags":null,"title":"Mechanism Design","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"I am the Teaching Assistant for the undergraduate course in Microeconomics at Bocconi University (code 30065)\nClasses CLEAM 1, for professor Nicoletta Corrocher (2021-on)\nCLEAM 2, for professors Fausto Panunzi and Monica Bonacina (2022-on)\nMaterials The entire course material is on the website Econ 101 ","date":1630450800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630450800,"objectID":"2ec77a095bace80e99748a5cd57923a2","permalink":"https://enricostivella.github.io/teaching/microeconomics101/","publishdate":"2021-09-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/teaching/microeconomics101/","section":"teaching","summary":"Teaching Assistant","tags":null,"title":"Econ 101","type":"teaching"}]
