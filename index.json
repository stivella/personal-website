I approached this question in two separate cases.\nThe first one pertains to the field of Economics of Science. In particular, I studied the careers of Italian nuclear scientists, whose field of studies was defunded after the Chernobyl disaster. I found that these scientists were not successful in transferring their skills to other fields, as their human capital was too specific.\nIn a second project, with Angelo D’Andrea (Bank of Italy), I consider a different population of movers: bank managers. Combining Italian data on bank managers’careers with data on bank lending, I find that when a bank manager moves to a new bank, 5% of their previous bank’s clients follow them.\nDownload my CV.\n","date":1693526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1693526400,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am a 5th-year Phd student in Economics at Bocconi University.

The course I taught was an introduction to game theory. I covered the basics of game theory, including the concepts of Nash equilibrium, dominant strategies, and the prisoner’s dilemma. I introduced students to the concept of repeated games, and the idea of subgame perfect equilibria. Lastly, I gave them an overview of some more advanced topics, such as evolutionary game theory or incomplete information interactions (such as Akerlof’s lemons model or auctions). The course was taught in English and was designed to be interactive, with students working on problems in groups.\nMaterials The entire course material is on the website Summer School ","date":1720393200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1720393200,"objectID":"0275d777895c638924a4302fca77d84d","permalink":"https://stivella.github.io/teaching/econ101/","publishdate":"2024-07-08T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/teaching/econ101/","section":"teaching","summary":"Instructor","tags":null,"title":"Game Theory","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"I am the Teaching Assistant for the undergraduate course in Microeconomics at Bocconi University (code 30065)\nClasses CLEAM 1, for professor Nicoletta Corrocher (2021-on)\nCLEAM 2, for professors Fausto Panunzi and Monica Bonacina (2022-on)\nMaterials The entire course material is on the website Econ 101 ","date":1694473200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694473200,"objectID":"434cc1df6a35063388caa77864ecbb1d","permalink":"https://stivella.github.io/teaching/econ101-summer-school/","publishdate":"2023-09-12T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/teaching/econ101-summer-school/","section":"teaching","summary":"Teaching Assistant","tags":null,"title":"Econ 101","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"I am the Teaching Assistant for the undergraduate course in Macroeconomics at Bocconi University (code 30066)\nClasses CLEF 9 and 10, for professor Michela Braga (Spring 2023 and 2024) Materials The entire course material is on the website Econ 102 ","date":1694473200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694473200,"objectID":"b2e55dee053c44e14808556bd1488f01","permalink":"https://stivella.github.io/teaching/econ102/","publishdate":"2023-09-12T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/teaching/econ102/","section":"teaching","summary":"Teaching Assistant","tags":null,"title":"Econ 102","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"I am the Teaching Assistant for the undergraduate course in Industry Analysis at Bocconi University (code 20133 )\nClasses CLEAM 8, for professor Mariarosa Battagion, Christian Garavaglia and Stefano Breschi (2022-on)\nCLEAM 9, for professor Mariarosa Battagion, Myriam Mariani and Stefano Breschi (2022-on)\nMaterials The entire course material is on the website Industry analysis ","date":1694473200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694473200,"objectID":"b99482215879d42c3c67e7475db71868","permalink":"https://stivella.github.io/teaching/industryanalysis/","publishdate":"2023-09-12T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/teaching/industryanalysis/","section":"teaching","summary":"Teaching Assistant","tags":null,"title":"Industry Analysis","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"I am the Teaching Assistant for the undergraduate course in Mechanism Design at Bocconi University (code 30419)\nClasses BEMACS 2021-22, for professors Fausto Panunzi and Tangren Feng\nBEMACS 2022-23, 2023-24, for professor Nenad Kos\nMaterials The entire course material is on the website Mech Design ","date":1694473200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694473200,"objectID":"391891a880a32a85d3529e867b650bad","permalink":"https://stivella.github.io/teaching/mechdesign/","publishdate":"2023-09-12T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/teaching/mechdesign/","section":"teaching","summary":"Teaching Assistant","tags":null,"title":"Mechanism Design","type":"teaching"},{"authors":["Enrico Stivella"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1693526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693526400,"objectID":"228d27b56e1f2977a8656c43a24364a1","permalink":"https://stivella.github.io/publication/procurementsbir/","publishdate":"2023-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/procurementsbir/","section":"publication","summary":"Economists have been long debating about the effectiveness of policies aimed at inducing directed technical change. Policymakers can use several tools, such as military-driven public investment, research grants, or public procurement. I examine a unique amalgamation of such tools in a US context, where small businesses winning federal research grants (SBIR) can also secure procurement contracts from the Department of Defense.
