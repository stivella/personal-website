Using Italian administrative data, we directly measure these relationships by linking bank managers to their portfolios of client firms and tracking their movements across financial institutions. We show that when a manager switches employers, firms in her prior portfolio become 3.5 times more likely to establish a lending relationship with her new bank. This portability arises because managers lower firms’ switching costs rather than generating adverse selection. We observe a threefold increase in loan applications to the new bank from prior clients but only a modest rise in approval rates. Firms that follow managers pay 0.9 percentage points lower interest rates than on their prior loans but similar rates to other new borrowers at the same bank. Managers transfer valuable information across banks: relationship-originated loans are 4 percentage points less likely to default than other new loans. To isolate the causal role of manager mobility, we exploit variation in the timing of job switches and control for credit demand and supply shocks. In a separate analysis, we also leverage exogenous shocks to mobility induced by branch closures.","tags":[],"title":"Bankers on the Move: Relationship Capital in Credit Markets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Enrico Stivella"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1760918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1760918400,"objectID":"228d27b56e1f2977a8656c43a24364a1","permalink":"https://stivella.github.io/publication/procurementsbir/","publishdate":"2025-10-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/procurementsbir/","section":"publication","summary":"Economists have been long debating about the effectiveness of policies aimed at inducing directed technical change. Policymakers can use several tools, such as military-driven public investment, research grants, or public procurement. I examine a unique amalgamation of such tools in a US context, where small businesses winning federal research grants (SBIR) can also secure procurement contracts from the Department of Defense. Employing a Difference-in-Differences framework and three comprehensive datasets - SBIR grants, DoD procurement contracts (USAspending.gov), and Patstat - I find that while procurement contract winners do not patent more than other SBIR participants, they get 1 million dollars more in government contracts every year.","tags":[],"title":"Procuring innovation: evidence from the SBIR program","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Enrico Stivella"],"categories":null,"content":"Presented at EDGE Jamboree (UCD Dublin, Sept ‘24) • Società Italiana degli Economisti (L’Aquila, Oct ‘23) • Milan PhD Workshop (Bocconi-PoliMi, Sept ‘23) • Reading Group in Innovation Studies (Pisa, June ‘23)\n","date":1746057600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1746057600,"objectID":"be05d7ca8243c9a011e51327b09f1389","permalink":"https://stivella.github.io/publication/nuclearscience/","publishdate":"2025-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nuclearscience/","section":"publication","summary":"Scientists’ human capital is the main factor in the production of knowledge. I study how ﬂexible ﬁeld-speciﬁc human capital is, trying to understand if researchers can bring valuable contributions to innovation out of their main ﬁeld of studies. I focus on the careers of Italian nuclear scientists before and after the Chernobyl disaster of 1986. In 1987 in Italy a referendum stopped the production of nuclear energy, and strongly reduced fundings to research in that ﬁeld. Using data from Microsoft Academic Graph, I show that after Chernobyl the amount of Italian papers published in nuclear ﬁssion decreased by 50%. Researchers who had already published in ﬁssion experienced a reduction of 24% in their citations, and 7% in published papers 15 years after the shock. Compared to other physicists, they neither moved more frequently, nor contributed permanently to more new ﬁelds.","tags":[],"title":"Scientific resilience: How Italian nuclear physics changed after the Chernobyl disaster","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"I was the main instructor for the Bocconi summer school course in Game Theory\nDescription Bocconi holds a summer school for high school students who are interested in economics. The course I taught was an introduction to game theory. I covered the basics of game theory, including the concepts of Nash equilibrium, dominant strategies, and the prisoner’s dilemma. I introduced students to the concept of repeated games, and the idea of subgame perfect equilibria. Lastly, I gave them an overview of some more advanced topics, such as evolutionary game theory or incomplete information interactions (such as Akerlof’s lemons model or auctions). The course was taught in English and was designed to be interactive, with students working on problems in groups.\nMaterials The entire course material is on the website Summer School ","date":1720393200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1720393200,"objectID":"0275d777895c638924a4302fca77d84d","permalink":"https://stivella.github.io/teaching/econ101/","publishdate":"2024-07-08T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/teaching/econ101/","section":"teaching","summary":"Instructor","tags":null,"title":"Game Theory","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"I am the Teaching Assistant for the undergraduate course in Microeconomics at Bocconi University (code 30065)\nClasses CLEAM 1, for professor Nicoletta Corrocher (2021-on)\nCLEAM 2, for professors Fausto Panunzi and Monica Bonacina (2022-on)\nMaterials The entire course material is on the website Econ 101 ","date":1694473200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694473200,"objectID":"434cc1df6a35063388caa77864ecbb1d","permalink":"https://stivella.github.io/teaching/econ101-summer-school/","publishdate":"2023-09-12T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/teaching/econ101-summer-school/","section":"teaching","summary":"Teaching Assistant","tags":null,"title":"Econ 101","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"I am the Teaching Assistant for the undergraduate course in Macroeconomics at Bocconi University (code 30066)\nClasses CLEF 9 and 10, for professor Michela Braga (Spring 2023 and 2024) Materials The entire course material is on the website Econ 102 ","date":1694473200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694473200,"objectID":"b2e55dee053c44e14808556bd1488f01","permalink":"https://stivella.github.io/teaching/econ102/","publishdate":"2023-09-12T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/teaching/econ102/","section":"teaching","summary":"Teaching Assistant","tags":null,"title":"Econ 102","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"I am the Teaching Assistant for the undergraduate course in Industry Analysis at Bocconi University (code 20133 )\nClasses CLEAM 8, for professor Mariarosa Battagion, Christian Garavaglia and Stefano Breschi (2022-on)\nCLEAM 9, for professor Mariarosa Battagion, Myriam Mariani and Stefano Breschi (2022-on)\nMaterials The entire course material is on the website Industry analysis ","date":1694473200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694473200,"objectID":"b99482215879d42c3c67e7475db71868","permalink":"https://stivella.github.io/teaching/industryanalysis/","publishdate":"2023-09-12T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/teaching/industryanalysis/","section":"teaching","summary":"Teaching Assistant","tags":null,"title":"Industry Analysis","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"I am the Teaching Assistant for the undergraduate course in Mechanism Design at Bocconi University (code 30419)\nClasses BEMACS 2021-22, for professors Fausto Panunzi and Tangren Feng\nBEMACS 2022-23, 2023-24, for professor Nenad Kos\nMaterials The entire course material is on the website Mech Design ","date":1694473200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694473200,"objectID":"391891a880a32a85d3529e867b650bad","permalink":"https://stivella.github.io/teaching/mechdesign/","publishdate":"2023-09-12T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/teaching/mechdesign/","section":"teaching","summary":"Teaching Assistant","tags":null,"title":"Mechanism Design","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"I am the Teaching Assistant for the undergraduate course in Strategic Decision Making and Markets at Bocconi University (code 30458) and Market, Organization and Incentives (30283)\nClasses Teaching Assistant to professor Chiara Fumagalli (2022-on) Materials 30458: The entire course material is on the website Decision Making 30283: The entire course material is on the website Markets ","date":1661986800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661986800,"objectID":"cd42da69854d65523382beff1e515b01","permalink":"https://stivella.github.io/teaching/strategicdecision/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/teaching/strategicdecision/","section":"teaching","summary":"Teaching Assistant","tags":null,"title":"Strategic Decision Making and Markets","type":"teaching"}]
