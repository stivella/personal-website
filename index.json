Second, when and how should the public sector direct technological change? I tried to answer to the first question by studying the careers of Italian nuclear scientists, whose field of studies was defunded after the Chernobyl disaster. In another project I studied how public procurement impacts US innovative small businesses.\nDownload my CV.\n","date":1693526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1693526400,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am a Phd student in Economics at Bocconi University.

Policymakers can use several tools, such as military-driven public investment, research grants, or public procurement. I examine a unique amalgamation of such tools in a US context, where small busi- nesses winning federal research grants (SBIR) can also secure procurement con- tracts from the Department of Defense. Employing a Difference-in-Differences framework and three comprehensive datasets - SBIR grants, DoD procurement contracts (USAspending.gov), and Patstat - I find that while procurement con- tract winners do not patent more than other SBIR participants, they get 1 million dollars more in government contracts every year.","tags":[],"title":"Procuring innovation: evidence from the SBIR program","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Enrico Stivella"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661990400,"objectID":"be05d7ca8243c9a011e51327b09f1389","permalink":"https://stivella.github.io/publication/nuclearscience/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nuclearscience/","section":"publication","summary":"Scientists’ human capital is the main factor in the production of knowledge. I study how ﬂexible ﬁeld-speciﬁc human capital is, trying to understand if researchers can bring valuable contributions to innovation out of their main ﬁeld of studies. I focus on the careers of Italian nuclear scientists before and after the Chernobyl disaster of 1986. In 1987 in Italy a referendum stopped the production of nuclear energy, and strongly reduced fundings to research in that ﬁeld. Using data from Microsoft Academic Graph, I show that after Chernobyl the amount of Italian papers published in nuclear ﬁssion decreased by 50%. Researchers who had already published in ﬁssion experienced a reduction of 24% in their citations, and 7% in published papers 15 years after the shock. Compared to other physicists, they neither moved more frequently, nor contributed permanently to more new ﬁelds.","tags":[],"title":"Scientific resilience: How Italian nuclear physics changed after the Chernobyl disaster","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"I am the Teaching Assistant for the undergraduate course in Strategic Decision Making and Markets at Bocconi University (code 30458) and Market, Organization and Incentives (30283)\nClasses Teaching Assistant to professor Chiara Fumagalli (2022-on) Materials 30458: The entire course material is on the website Decision Making 30283: The entire course material is on the website Markets ","date":1661986800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661986800,"objectID":"cd42da69854d65523382beff1e515b01","permalink":"https://stivella.github.io/teaching/strategicdecision/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/teaching/strategicdecision/","section":"teaching","summary":"Teaching Assistant","tags":null,"title":"Strategic Decision Making and Markets","type":"teaching"}]
